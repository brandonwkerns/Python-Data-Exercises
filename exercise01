Exercise 1

The objectives of this exercise are to:
-Set up the linux environment for python/ipython.
-Read in netcdf surface meteorological data.
-Plot a time series or meteogram of the surface data.


1) Set your environment to work with the Python setup.

When you log in to a desktop machine or ssh in to the manta server, the special file .cshrc or .bashrc gets run, which sets up your user environment.

If you are runing the csh or tcsh shell, .cshrc gets run. If you are using the bash shell, .bashrc gets run. To tell which script you are using, log in and use the following command: echo $SHELL

Create or edit the appropriate file under your home directory. 
For .cshrc, add this: 
setenv PATH "/home/python/anaconda2/envs/meteo/bin:$PATH"
For .bashrc, add this:
export PATH=/home/python/anaconda2/envs/meteo/bin:$PATH
(DO NOT add spaces around the = sign)

After you modify the file, log out and log back in. To check whether it worked, use the command "which python," you should get:
/home/python/anaconda2/envs/meteo/bin/python.
This version of Python has all the Python modules for dealing with meteorological data.


2) Set up directories for the exercise.

For these exercises, work under /home/disk/manta12/[your_user_name]
Create a directory there called ex01, and enter it. Work there for this exercise.

cd /home/disk/manta12/[your_user_name]
mkdir ex01
cd ex01


3) Modify the Python script below to plot the surface data for November 24 2011 at Gan Island in the central Indian Ocean.
The data are in the file:
/home/disk/manta8/data/field_experiments/dynamo/surfaceobs/gan/ganmetM1.b1.20111124.000000.cdf
you can see which variables are in the file using ncdump:
ncdump -h /home/disk/manta8/data/field_experiments/dynamo/surfaceobs/gan/ganmetM1.b1.20111124.000000.cdf
and preview it with ncview:
ncview /home/disk/manta8/data/field_experiments/dynamo/surfaceobs/gan/ganmetM1.b1.20111124.000000.cdf

Anaconda comes with a handy inteactive graphical environment called "spyder." To open it:
spyder & 
(The & at the end keeps the shell available for future commands).

The sample script plots the temperature. Add the dewpoint temperature in blue. 
-->You need to calculate it from the temperature and the RH.
-->Use the plt.hold function to plot two curves on the same graph.

4) Expand the script from 3) to have four panels: temperature and dewpoint, pressure, wind speed, rainfall.
